Native memory manipulation in VBA

Using ```CopyMemory``` API (RtlMoveMemory on Windows) is quite slow when used many times. Moreover, on some systems this Memory API is even slower due to certain software (e.g. Windows Defender - see [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57885185/windows-defender-extremly-slowing-down-macro-only-on-windows-10)). The API can become so slow that is pretty much unusable (e.g. on my x32 Windows machine it is 600 times slower than it used to be). Using the **LibMemory** module presented here overcomes the speed issues for reading and writing from and into memory.

## Implementation
Same technique used [here](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/249125/227582) was implemented. A remote Variant allows the changing of the VarType on a second Variant which in turn reads memory remotely as well (has VT_BYREF flag set). A single CopyMemory API call is done when initializing the base REMOTE_MEMORY structure (see ```MemIntAPI```). Subsequent usage relies on native VBA code only.

## Use
```MemCopy``` - a faster alternative to ```CopyMemory``` without API calls on Windows up to sizes of 2147483647 (max Long value and limitation of VB String). Uses a combination of fake BSTR and SAFEARRAY structures to copy memory.

10 parametric properties (Get/Let) are exposed:
 01. ```MemByte```
 02. ```MetInt```
 03. ```MemLong```
 04. ```MemLongPtr```
 05. ```MemLongLong``` (x64 only)
 06. ```MemBool```
 07. ```MemSng``` 
 08. ```MemCur```
 09. ```MemDate```
 10. ```MemDbl```

A few other utilities:
 - ```GetDefaultInterface```
 - ```MemObject``` (dereferences a pointer and returns an Object)
 - ```UnsignedAddition```
 - ```VarPtrArr``` (```VarPtr``` for arrays)
 - ```ArrPtr``` (as ```ObjPtr``` is for objects and ```StrPtr``` is for strings) - returns the pointer to the underlying SAFEARRAY structure
 - ```CloneParamArray``` - copies a param array to another array of Variants while preserving ByRef elements
 - ```GetArrayByRef``` - returns the input array wrapped in a ByRef Variant without copying the array
 - ```StringToIntegers``` - copies the memory of a String to an Array of Integers
 - ```EmptyArray``` - returns an empty array of the requested size and data type
 - ```UpdateLBound``` - changes the Lower Bound for a given array's dimension

## Class Instance Redirection

Class instance redirection is supported. This allows Private Class Initializers thus achieving true immutabilty.
Simply call the ```RedirectInstance``` method within a ```Private Function``` of any VB class to gain access to other instances of the same class.

See ```DemoInstanceRedirection``` method in the Demo module.

## Installation
Just import the following code modules in your VBA Project:
* [**LibMemory.bas**](https://github.com/cristianbuse/VBA-MemoryTools/blob/master/src/LibMemory.bas)

## Demo
Import the following code modules from the [demo folder](https://github.com/cristianbuse/VBA-MemoryTools/blob/master/src/Demo) in your VBA Project:
* [DemoLibMemory.bas](https://github.com/cristianbuse/VBA-MemoryTools/blob/master/src/Demo/DemoLibMemory.bas) - run ```DemoMain```
* [DemoClass](https://github.com/cristianbuse/VBA-MemoryTools/blob/master/src/Demo/DemoClass.cls)

## Testing
Just import [TestLibMemory.bas](https://github.com/cristianbuse/VBA-MemoryTools/blob/master/src/Test/TestLibMemory.bas) module and run method ```RunAllTests```. On failure, execution will stop on the first failed Assert.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/cristianbuse/VBA-MemoryTools/issues/new) if any test is failing.
